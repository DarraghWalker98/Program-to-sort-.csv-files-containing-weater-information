For this project i managed to get all the functionality working including the save function which was the most dificult,
for the first parts of the project it was mainly things that we had covered so i managed to get most of them working pretty quick,
the only difficult i ran into realy was the separate sort classes and the save function but with a bit of research i got it all figured out
