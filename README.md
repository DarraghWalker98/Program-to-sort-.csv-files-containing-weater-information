# Program-to-sort-.csv-files-containing-weater-information
Program was created as a final assignment for introduction to java in year 2 of a software and electronic engineering course. 
The function of the program is to read a csv file chosen by the user then store it in an ArrayList and dispay that information in a JTextArea.
The data can then be sorted using a number of compare to functions, these are engaged using the JButtons located 
on the left hand side of the JFrame. Once the data is re-sorted it is printed to the JTextArea. Once the user is happy with the contents of 
the JTextArea they can save that text in a new csv file that they can set the name of using the JTextField in the bottom left.
